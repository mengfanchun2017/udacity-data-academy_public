In the experiment, we're testing the change in layout of a product information page to see if this affects the proportion of people who click on a button to go to the download page. This experiment has been designed to have a cookie-based diversion, and we record two things from each user: which page version they received, and whether or not they accessed the download page during the data recording period. (We aren't keeping track of any other factors in this example, such as number of pageviews, or time between accessing the page and making the download, that might be of further interest.)\n",

    "\n",
    "First of all, we should check that the number of visitors assigned to each group is similar. It's important to check the invariant metrics as a prerequisite so that our inferences on the evaluation metrics are founded on solid ground. If we find that the two groups are imbalanced on the invariant metric, then this will require us to look carefully at how the visitors were split so that any sources of bias are accounted for. It's possible that a statistically significant difference in an invariant metric will require us to revise random assignment procedures and re-do data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want to do a two-sided hypothesis test on the proportion of visitors assigned to one of our conditions. Choosing the control or the experimental condition doesn't matter: you'll get the same result either way. Feel free to use whatever method you'd like: we'll highlight two main avenues below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take a simulation-based approach, you can simulate the number of visitors that would be assigned to each group for the number of total observations, assuming that we have an expected 50/50 split. Do this many times (200 000 repetitions should provide a good speed-variability balance in this case) and then see in how many simulated cases we get as extreme or more extreme a deviation from 50/50 that we actually observed. Don't forget that, since we have a two-sided test, an extreme case also includes values on the opposite side of 50/50. (e.g. Since simulated outcomes of .48 and lower are considered as being more extreme than an actual observation of 0.48, so too will simulated outcomes of .52 and higher.) The proportion of flagged simulation outcomes gives us a p-value on which to assess our observed proportion. We hope to see a larger p-value, insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take an analytic approach, you could use the exact binomial distribution to compute a p-value for the test. The more usual approach, however, is to use the normal distribution approximation. Recall that this is possible thanks to our large sample size and the central limit theorem. To get a precise p-value, you should also perform a \n",
    "continuity correction, either adding or subtracting 0.5 to the total count before computing the area underneath the curve. (e.g. If we had 415 / 850 assigned to the control group, then the normal approximation would take the area to the left of $(415 + 0.5) / 850 = 0.489$ and to the right of $(435 - 0.5) / 850 = 0.511$.)\n",

    "## 检查不变指标\n",
    "\n",
    "首先，我们应该检查分配给每组的用户人数是否差不多。务必要检查作为前提条件的不变指标，这样可以保证根据评估指标做出的推断有扎实的依据。如果我们发现两组在不变指标方面不平衡，则需要仔细观察访问者的划分方式，看看能否找出任何偏差原因。如果发现不变指标存在统计学显著性差异，则可能需要修改随机分配流程，并重新收集数据。\n",
    "\n",
    "在这种情形下，我们需要对分配给某个条件的访问者比例进行双边假设检验。选择对照组还是实验组并不重要：你会获得相同的结果。你可以选择使用任何一种方法，我们将在下面主要介绍两种方法。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你想采用模拟方法，你可以模拟分配到每组的访问者人数，假设按照 50/50 的比例划分。重复这一过程很多次（在此示例中，重复 200 000 次应该会达到很好的速度可变性平衡），然后看看有多少模拟情形完全偏离了 50/50 的分配结果。注意，由于我们完成的是双边检验，因此极端情况还包括 50/50 相反情形的值。（例如，由于 0.48 及更低的模拟结果被视为比 0.48 的实际观测值更极端，所以 0.52 及更高的模拟结果也一样。）我们可以根据被标记模拟结果的比例获得 p 值，并用p 值评估观察到的比例。我们希望看到更大的 p 值，表明拒绝零假设的证据不足。\n",
    "\n",
    "如果你想采取分析方法，可以使用精确二项分布计算检验的 p 值。但是，更常见的方法是使用正态分布逼近法。由于样本量很大，并且存在中心极限定理，因此这种逼近法是可行的。要获得精确的 p 值，还应该进行连续校正， \n",
    "在计算曲线下面积之前，使总数加上或减去 0.5。（例如，如果对照组的分配比例是 415 / 850，那么正态逼近计算的面积向左为 $(415 + 0.5) / 850 = 0.489$，向右为 $(435 - 0.5) / 850 = 0.511$。）\n",
