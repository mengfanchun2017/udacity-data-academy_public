The Public 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results

Description:

The enclosed data set is the full, cleaned results of the 2018 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally identifying information have been removed from the results to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:

1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. Developer_Survey_Instrument_2018.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument

The survey was fielded from January 8 to January 28, 2018. The median time spent on the survey for qualified responses was 25.8 minutes, and the median time for those who finished the entire survey was 29.4 minutes.

Respondents were recruited primarily through channels owned by Stack Overflow. The top 5 sources of respondents were banner ads, email lists, house ad, blog posts, and Twitter. Since respondents were recruited in this way, highly engaged users on Stack Overflow were more likely to notice the links for the survey and click to begin it. Respondents who finished the survey were awarded a "Census" badge as a motivation to complete the survey.
